# Plant-Watering-System
This is a plant monitoring and watering system, featuring real-time weather updates. Additionally, this project boasts a custom-designed PCB crafted by our team. I acquired sensor STL files from external sources, and the system provides insights into rain, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. 
For larger gardens, I installed two soil moisture sensors and a 4-relay module to manage four water pumps. Control is accessible via phone, allowing real-time monitoring of sensor data on both the phone and an LCD display. 

INTRO:
I implemented an innovative IoT project using the ESP32 microcontroller, equipped with a rain sensor, soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensor, ultrasonic sensor for measuring tank level, and a water pump.
The system allows remote control of water distribution through a mobile app. Real-time sensor readings, including rain, soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and tank level, are displayed on a 20x4 LCD and accessible through the mobile app.
